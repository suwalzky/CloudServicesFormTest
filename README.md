CloudServices - Using Selenium with C#.NET
===============


Attached is a test that is needed for recruiting purposes.

The test can be executed on three browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. The driver can be selected using 
the appsetting *DriverToUse* in the app.config file. To run the tests on Internet Explorer 11, the registry must be updated first so that the driver can maintain a connection to the browser. Import the registry file [configure_ie_11_for_selenium_iedriverserver.reg](https://github.com/atosorigin/SeleniumExample/blob/master/configure_ie_11_for_selenium_iedriverserver.reg) to achieve this. 

To run the Selenium test, you need to download the solution and run the NUnit tests. 


This solution is built on a repository:
